Bud should appear compact with a deep brown or tan color and no sign of translucency or green emerging underneath. Previous year’s leaves will most often come attached to the cutting and, though dead and wilted, should not be confused with new leaf growth.","Dormant terminal bud is roughly 1cm long, dark red with wide base that comes to a gable-shaped point similar to an okra fruit. Lateral buds typically flank each terminal bed and appear as pairs at any point along the length of the sample stem. Lateral buds are perhaps easier to identify as dormant, as they appear very small, < .5cm in length, and closely abut their adjacent stem.","Buds appear small and compact along sample. Single terminal bud is typically abutted by two lateral buds, forming a trident shape. ","Ovular, pointed buds appear along length of stem and on terminal. Species' buds are significantly more fragile than other woody species and are easily broken off of stem with contact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01,Beginning of bud swelling,,,"Swelling can be difficult to be determined for this species, considering that its leaf is contained in a thin sheath that does not necessarily swell in the same way an otherwise spherical bud of most other species does. Bud appears more obtuse and round than its dormant stage. The bud can also become slightly green due to its outer sheath expanding and its respective leaf showing through from below.","Buds are subtly more spherical when swelling than when dormant. Lateral buds also have a tendency to expand apart from their adjacent stem, creating a gap between the two, respectively.","Buds have swollen, with lateral buds expanding outward. Terminal bud often begins to show subtle shade of green before breaking","Buds appear rounter at their base, producing a spade shape with exterior showing shades of yellow, tan, or light green. Buds are also generally larger than previous dormancy stage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,03,End of bud swelling,,,"Swelling appears more apparent than previously recorded, but with no break in the outer sheeth of the bud.","Buds show significant swelling since previous measurement, but have yet to break","Buds show significant swelling since previous measurement, but have yet to break.","Buds show significant swelling since previous measurement, but have yet to break.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,07,Beginning of sprouting or bud breaking; shoot emergence,,,"Bud sheath has broken open, revealing a still-folded leaf underneath.","Both terminal and lateral buds form slight split at their top, revealing green below. The lengthwise crack looks similar to that of a pistachio nut whose shell is still intact. It is important to note that stage 03 is often missed, since it Stage 04 quickly proceeds the formation of this crack.",Terminal bud shows distinct crack or break at apex.,Not used for species,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,09,Buds show green tips,Leaf budburst,"In at least 3 locations on the plant, an emerging leaf is visible. A leaf is considered ""emerging"" once the green tip is visible at the end of the leaf bud, but before it has fully unfolded to expose the petiole (leaf stalk) or leaf base.",not used sp.,A green tip has emerged from the described crack in Stage 03. Stage 04 most often occurs in terminal buds before lateral buds. The tip itself will have a light green color and should emerge directly from the top of the bud. ,"Most often appearing on sample's terminal, green tip has broken through apex of bud.",At least one bud on stem shows a distinct green tip breaking through bud scales. Most often occurrs on terminal bud of sample before lateral buds. Green tip is a light green color if not significantly white from pubescence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,Green leaf tips 10 mm above the bud scales,,,not used sp.,Green tip has lengthened to at least 1cm above the end of the bud scales. ,Triangular green tip has extended at least 1cm above bud scales. Bud may often enlarge and split lengthwise to reveal yet unfolded leaf with prominent leaf veins underneath.,Previous stage's green leaf tip has extended to 1cm above respective bud's scales.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Principal growth stage 1: leaf and needle development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11,First leaves unfolded,First leaf,,"Leaf has broken through bud sheath and unfolded. Leaf most often emergest at once, with its sheath decidedly falling off after breaking from previous stage.","Intermediary leaf tip can lengthen above its parent bud scales up to 2cm, including both terminals and laterals. Similar to the bud itself, this sheath often splits lengthwise to reveal the yet-unfurled leaf it contains. Even during this splitting, when the leaf parts are visible but not unfolded, the sample should be marked as yet emerged. It is important to reserve stage 06 as each species’ most apparent state of “leaf-out.” ","First leaf has unfolded from bud, appearing as opposite pair per bud.","First leaf has unfolded from bud, most often appear as a leaf pair or cluster of leaves from single bud.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15,"More leaves unfolded, but not yet at full size. First leaves unfolded",,,Leaves have emerged and unfolded from multiple buds along the length of the sample. ,"A single leaf has emerged from its bud. This species will nearly always produce one initial leaf from any given bud, unlike other species which more often yield pairs of leaves. Terminal buds will likely reach Stage 06 before lateral buds. However, in cases of precocious lateral buds, first leaves will appear on the base of the sample.",Multiple leaves have unfolded along length of sample.,Multiple leaves have unfolded along length of sample.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17,Most leaves unfolded on majority of tree,75% of full leaf size,"In at least 3 locations on the plant, an unfolded leaf is visible.
